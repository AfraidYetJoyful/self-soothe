Just outside the iron gate is a narrow, long room. The room is earthen architecture. Its edges are blunted into soothing curves. There are two small shelves dug deep into the wall facing the outside world. On each side of the gate stand a smooth, strong box of earth a few feet tall, which serve as a bench. You enter, putting in the code to the combination lock, opening the gate, closing it, and locking the gate once more. You put down your two wooden boxes on the right bench, and remove the two wooden boxes in the left alcove-- one large, one small, and set them down beside you on the bench. You look at the statue in the right alcove. You put your two wooden boxes into the left alcove. Within the larger box are rations-- trail butter, today. Within the smaller box is a small scrap of paper upon which you've carefully copied a poem. You scoop up yesterday's boxes into your lap, and close your eyes. You pray for the wellbeing of the travellers who take refuge here. You pray for protection against storms. You open your eyes again onto the room, its shade, the light pouring in through the archway, the soft curves of the room, the stone statue carved by another. You pick up the wooden boxes, rise, unlock the lock, enter through the iron gate, and lock the lock again, setting each number to 0 before continuing onwards.
